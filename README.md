To download the urbanSound8K dataset go to: https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html

To download the YBSS-200 dataset go to: https://github.com/project-noise-2019/ybss-200

To download my own collected dataset together with the spectrograms go to: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14Zo1XZR7A8IXguFVMhGemsIL2rgyr39x?usp=share_link

To run the code, you can either run the .h5 files with the spectrograms directly to the notebook or you can first run the feature extraction scripts with the audios to extract the spectrograms and then run the notebook.
